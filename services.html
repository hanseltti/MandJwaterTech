                                        <ol>
                                          <li>Reduced Mineral Buildup: Water softener systems work by removing minerals such as calcium and magnesium from your water supply. This helps reduce the buildup of mineral deposits in your pipes and appliances, which can extend their lifespan and save you money on repairs and replacements.</li>
                                          <li>Soft, Clean Hair and Skin: Hard water can leave a residue on your hair and skin, making it feel dry and itchy. Water softener systems remove the minerals that cause hard water, resulting in softer, cleaner hair and skin.</li>
                                          <li>Energy Savings: When your pipes and appliances are clogged with mineral buildup, they have to work harder to function properly. Water softener systems can help reduce mineral buildup, which can lead to improved energy efficiency and lower energy bills.</li>
                                          <li>Longer-Lasting Clothing: Hard water can cause clothing to fade and wear out more quickly. Water softener systems can help preserve the color and quality of your clothing, which can save you money on replacements over time.</li>
                                          <li>Cleaner Dishes and Surfaces: Hard water can leave spots and streaks on your dishes and surfaces. Water softener systems can help eliminate these spots and keep your dishes and surfaces cleaner.</li>

                    <h2 class="text-center text-white centeringH2onDiv">Should I Test My Water Before Buying a Water Softener System?</h2>
                  </div>
                  <p class="lead mx-5 mt-5">We strongly recommend doing a water test before installing a water softening system. Why? Because it may save money.</p>
                  <p class="lead mx-5">Even if your home is located in a hard water region of the country, your water supply may be the exception. Perhaps your city’s water source is hard, but your private well water isn’t. Why buy a water softener system if you don’t need one?</p>
                  <p class="lead mx-5">Softeners also have limitations based on your water chemistry. With some, for example, you’ll need to remove even low levels of iron and tannins from your water or risk ruining the softener resin.</p>
                  <p class="lead mx-5">Knowing how hard your water is also helps you choose the right size softener. Models that are too small will regenerate too often, wasting pounds of salt. Systems that are too large may not soften properly.</p>
                  <p class="lead mx-5">The good news is that testing your water is simple. If you don’t have a laboratory nearby, purchase a home test kit online. They’re a breeze to use.</p>
                  <p class="lead mx-5">If this is the first time you’ve done a water test, we recommend Simple Lab’s Tap Score. You can choose from city or well water test kits that check for hardness minerals and many other contaminants. If it’s been a while since you’ve evaluated your water quality, we suggest doing a comprehensive analysis.</p>
                  <p class="lead mx-5 mb-5">Kits come with everything you need. Just send them a sample of tap water, and in a few weeks, you’ll get a detailed report, including non-biased guidance on water treatment products. You can trust their recommendation because they don’t sell softeners.</p>
