                  <h3 class="text-center py-5 bg-light">Water softener benefits include:</h3>
                  <h4 class="mx-5 pt-5">Healthier Skin and Hair</h4>
                  <p class="lead mx-5 mb-5">Hardness minerals are tough on skin and hair. They prevent shampoo and body wash from lathering effectively, leaving behind an irritating layer of soap scum. If you feel itchy after a shower or never quite clean, hard water may be to blame.</p>
                  <h4 class="mx-5">Cleaner, Brighter Clothes</h4>
                  <p class="lead mx-5 mb-5">Similarly, hard water minerals decrease laundry detergent efficiency. You’ll need more soap to get your clothes clean, and bright colors may fade within a few washes.</p>
                  <h4 class="mx-5">Better Tasting Water</h4>
                  <p class="lead mx-5 mb-5">Magnesium and calcium can also make your drinking water taste bad, giving it an unpleasant chalky or metallic edge. The jury is out on whether softened water tastes better, but if you’re reaching for bottles, a water softener may remove unwanted tastes.</p>
                  <h4 class="mx-5">Less Cleaning</h4>
                  <p class="lead mx-5 mb-5">Hard water mineral deposits leave unsightly stains on your plumbing fixtures and shower doors. Corrosive, they can also eat away at metal. Soft water means easier cleaning. <br>
                    Hard water is also responsible for water spots. As water evaporates on dishes, calcium carbonate precipitates out, leaving a filmy white residue on dishes. Abrasive, it can etch fine glassware over time.</p>
                  <h4 class="mx-5">Fewer Appliance Repairs</h4>
                  <p class="lead mx-5 mb-5">The reason most homeowners turn to water softeners is to prevent mineral buildup in pipes and water-using appliances. Limescale clogs plumbing, ruins household appliances from coffee machines to ice makers, and makes water heaters less efficient. Mineral-coated water heater elements can hike your electric bill up to 30-percent.

                    The bottom line is —life can get pretty expensive without soft water systems.</p>
                  <h4 class="mx-5">Taste</h4>
                  <p class="lead mx-5 mb-5">Hard water has an unpleasant taste, but soft water can be equally off-putting. The lack of minerals can make water taste flat and even a little salty. The extra sodium in softened water also throws off recipes. You may need to make minor adjustments when cooking.</p>
